This layer analysis is obviously for lethal company, and not Content Warning. 

If there is any intention of implementing No Post Processing in Content Warning then a similar layer analysis would need to be performed,
as well as a method to remove that post processing. 

Of course if there's no need then there's no need. Lethal Company was very crusty after all.
