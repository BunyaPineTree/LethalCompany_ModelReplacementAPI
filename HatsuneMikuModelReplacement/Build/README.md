# Miku Model Replacement v1.5.0
### Replaces suits with Hatsune Miku. This is the example mod for ModelReplacementAPI

## Instructions
- Place contents in plugins folder. Ensure that ModelReplacementAPI is also installed. 
- Set your preferred replacement suits in the config, or enable miku for all suits. By default the starting suit is replaced. 
- For more info see https://github.com/BunyaPineTree/LethalCompany_ModelReplacementAPI
## Known Issues
- Cloth physics can be very laggy. ~~It is recommended in larger lobbies that you lower the dynamic bone update rate and disable physics at range via the config.~~ Physics configs temporarily do not function as a result of the switch away from Dynamic Bones.
- Miku is a flashbang as a result of the toon shader currently used. 
- Does not replace hands. You will only see Miku in multiplayer lobbies or with a third person mod. 

## Note
Note that in the config there are separate suit name lists for each miku skin. Every suit selected in both will be assigned a Miku model replacement, and every suit selected in the Evil Miku suit list will be assigned the alternate skin, regardless of the contents of the normal Miku suit list.
